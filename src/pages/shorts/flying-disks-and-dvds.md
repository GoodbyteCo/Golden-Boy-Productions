It's International Frisbee Day, and siblings Lazo and Svetlana are enjoying it the
best way anyone can: by playing frisbee, of course! But when Svetlana launches Lazo's
favourite frisbee clear across the park, they must embark on a grand journey to get
it back. Along the way, they learn some valuable life lessons regarding scary old
ladies, buyer's remorse, and the ever-changing landscape of media distribution.
