		# You should know...

		David Vassos is the director, founder, and head honcho here at Golden Boy.
		His gigantic, hugely smart brain serves as the creative foundation for all
		of our outstanding cinematic masterpieces. When he's not making films, David
		is most likely cooking something overly complicated, losing at Super Smash
		Bros., or running around in a big open field.
