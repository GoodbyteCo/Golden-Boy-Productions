Your Student Government is the story of two university students, theatre kid Suzzy
Reeves and computer scientist Iris Powell. The two find themselves out of their
element when they decide, as a jolke, to run for their school’s government. Unbeknownst
to them, Machiavelli fanboy Benjamin Weens, pragmatic Madison Spencer, and wide
eyed and kindhearted Gunther Trost are running for real as Team WST. With their
once secured victory destroyed, WST replaces Gunther with Julian Thacker, a crass
and crude party boy, while Suzzy and Iris must learn how to cope with their newfound
fame and the election’s effect on their longtime friendship.
